				<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
				<h2>Jake Gemerek</h2>
				<p>
				  I'm a robotics PhD with industry experience in software engineering and 
				  diverse autonomy applications. With a strong background in machine learning, 
				  computer vision, and AI for real-time motion control systems, I bring versatility 
				  and expertise to the field of robotics.
				</p>
				<p>
				  After completing my PhD at Cornell University, I joined Moog's Technology and 
				  Advanced Pursuits group in 2020. Here, I have been instrumental in developing 
				  innovative autonomous solutions across sectors such as space, defense, and 
				  onstruction. My contributions span from perception and navigation algorithm 
				  development to diverse applications like autonomous construction equipment, 
				  reinforcement learning-controlled excavator arms, and defense industry multi-object 
				  tracking.
				</p>
				<p>
				  Prior to joining Moog, I served as a Research Assistant at Cornell's Laboratory 
				  for Intelligent Systems and Controls (LISC). During my time there, I devised novel 
				  methods and algorithms by merging real-time computer vision with automatic control 
				  theory. I focused on intelligent scene perception and control solutions for the 
				  Office of Naval Research (ONR), targeting resource-constrained mobile platforms.
				</p>
				<p>
				  Throughout my career, I have excelled in leading cross-functional teams, conducting 
				  independent research, and effectively communicating complex concepts to diverse 
				  audiences. My results-driven approach has led to securing substantial research 
				  funding and showcasing my expertise at flagship conferences and publications. As a 
				  confident technology communicator, I am dedicated to making complex scientific concepts 
				  accessible and fostering trust among peers, collaborators, and clients.
				</p>
				<p>
				  I bring a wealth of experience from my roles as a Systems Engineer at Moog Inc., a 
				  Graduate Research Assistant and Teaching Assistant at Cornell University, and an 
				  Undergraduate Research Assistant at the State University of New York at Buffalo. 
				  My educational journey includes a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Mechanical Engineering 
				  and a Master of Science (MS) in Mechanical Engineering from Cornell University, as well 
				  as a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering from the 
				  University at Buffalo.
				</p>
				<p>
				  I'm thrilled to share my knowledge, experiences, and ongoing projects through this 
				  website. Join me as we delve into the fascinating world of robotics, AI, and 
				  autonomous systems, and discover the endless possibilities of cutting-edge technology!
